# DiscordBot Privacy Policy

### What's collected?
DiscordBot logs some information it receives for anti-abuse and debugging purposes. Below is a list of what information is currently collected

* Messages sent to the bot via DM
* Messages sent to a text channel
  * DiscordBot will only log text chat for channels that its applicable role (if any) has the "Read Messages" permission for.
    * Note that DiscordBot will also not reply to commands in channels where this permission is not granted.
* When a user edits one of their messages, including the new message.
* When a user joins or leaves the server
* When a user changes status (nickname, game, online status, etc.)
* When a channel (text or voice) is created or deleted on a server

Below is a list of things that are **NOT** logged

* Voice chat
  * While DoscordBot is aware of Voice channels (it can "see" them in the server's channel list) on a server, it does not monitor them (it's a bot, after all)
* DMs with other users on the server
* Anything else that is not listed here or in the list above

### What is done with my info?
Aside from the abuse handing and bug debugging mentioned above? Absolutely nothing. Nothing is done with your information. It is not shared, it is not even looked at unless there is a problem that needs to be addressed. Your secrets are safe; if your girlfriend finds out you're going to surprise her with a proposal, it won't be through me.
